## 🛠️ Key Skills & Techniques Used

This project showcases proficiency in the core capabilities of Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting.

### Data Preparation & Formulas

* **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Handled missing values, ensured data consistency, and standardized date formats in the raw dataset.
* **Advanced Formulas:** Utilized **`VLOOKUP`** (implied by Sheet2's categorization),

* **Sorting & Filtering:** Applied **advanced sorting and multi-level filtering** to quickly isolate and analyze specific subsets of data (e.g., finding top students/sales in specific subjects/regions).

### Data Modeling & Aggregation

* **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts:** Created several multi-dimensional **Pivot Tables** to aggregate, summarize, and cross-tabulate data, including:
    * Total Sales analysis by **Product Category and Gender**.
    * Sales Volume analysis by **Country and Product** (Laptops, Printers, Smartphones).
* **Data Aggregation:** Calculated totals, percentages, and performance ratios (e.g., percentage contribution to total sales).

### Reporting & Visualization

* **Dashboard Creation (Implied):** Structured and linked multiple sheets and Pivot Tables to create a comprehensive, interactive reporting environment.
* **Data Presentation:** Used **Conditional Formatting** (implied) to visually highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends within the datasets and summaries.
